# Dev Notes

Security Monkey is a two part app;
the Flask app serves a JSON REST API,
the front end is written in Dart.

## Structure

Security monkey has been developed with a very flat structure,
Models are in datastore.py, Views in the views folder,
Routes live in __init__.py

alerter.py, auditors, reporter.py, scheduler.py and watcher.py make up the scheduler that monitors AWS.

duo_web contains the code provided by duo to do MFA
